**Welcome to the Drone codebase, we are thrilled to have you here!** 


## What is Drone?
Drone is a continuous delivery system built on container technology. Drone uses a simple YAML configuration file, a superset of docker-compose, to define and execute Pipelines inside Docker containers. we have two versions available: the [Enterprise Edition](https://github.com/drone/drone/blob/master/BUILDING) and the [Community Edition](https://github.com/drone/drone/blob/master/BUILDING_OSS)

_Please note the official Docker images run the Drone Enterprise distribution. If you would like to run the Community Edition you can build from source by following the instructions in [BUILDING_OSS](https://github.com/drone/drone/blob/master/BUILDING_OSS)._

### Setup Documentation

This section of the [documentation](http://docs.drone.io/installation/) will help you install and configure the Drone Server and one or many Runners. A runner is a standalone daemon that polls the server for pending pipelines to execute.

### Usage Documentation

Pipelines help you automate steps in your software delivery process, such as initiating code builds, running automated tests, and deploying to a staging or production environment. Our [documentation](http://docs.drone.io/getting-started/) can help you get started with the different types of pipelines. Each optimized for different use cases and runtime environments.


### Plugin Index

We have an extensive registry of community plugins to customize your continuous delivery pipeline, you can find those [here](http://plugins.drone.io/).
